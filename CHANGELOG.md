## [1.2.0] – 2025-07-01

> ⚠️ **This version requires a Doctrine migration** (new fields in `PageCall` and `PageCallHit`)

### ✨ Added
- Field `bot` in `PageCall`: detects and flags bot-related traffic.
- Fields in `PageCallHit`:
    - `bot`: flags bot visits based on User-Agent and heuristics.
    - `pageTitle`: stores the document title (provided by JS).
    - `delaySincePreviousHit`: calculates delay (in seconds) since `parentHit` if available.
    - `pageType`: stores an optional value representing the semantic type of the page (e.g. `home`, `form`, `contact`, etc.).
- Fallback handling for Stimulus tracking controller using HTML `data-*` attributes and `Values API`.

### 🧰 Developer Experience
- Updated README.md with new examples, shields, and clearer usage instructions.
- Improved exception handling in Stimulus controller.
- Added JS fallback in case of execution errors to ensure graceful degradation.

- File `CONTRIBUTING.md` added for contributors.
